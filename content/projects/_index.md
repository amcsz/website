# Projects
This is a list of programming projects I've worked on. It may be incomplete, but my [github](https://github.com/amcsz) has most of the code I've written.

### TJCT Autograder v2

I refactored my school's computer team's online judge; it is similar to codeforces and holds in-house contests regularly for our school.

The system was written using Python and uses Django, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Daphne. The application runs user code upon submission (through nsjail sandboxing) to a specific problem from a contest, and automatically calculates contest standings afterwards.
